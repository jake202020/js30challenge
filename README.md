# Wes Bos 30 Day Challenge
30 Challenges of vanilla JavaScript codealongs with Wes Bos.

The index-Start.html file is given by Wes to begin at the same place and the index.html is where I have coded ahead and/or along with Wes' video to complete the challenge.

The index.html not in a folder is for challenge 08 - Fun with HTML Canvas in order to be available with Github Pages (with mobile functionality): https://jake202020.github.io/js30challenge/ Hold down your mouse left-click (or finger on mobile) and move to draw.
